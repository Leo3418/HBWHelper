## Installation
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Leo3418/HBWHelper/releases) page,
download a JAR file for the Minecraft version you are using, and copy it into
the `mods` folder under your Minecraft game directory.

### Deciphering JAR File Names
The format of file names on the Releases page is `MCVERSION-MODVERSION`.
- `MCVERSION` indicates the Minecraft client version(s) that this JAR file
supports.  
Sometimes, one JAR file supports multiple Minecraft client versions. In this
case, this field's format will be `.OLDESTVERSION.LATESTVERSION.`. The client
versions supported are from `OLDESTVERSION` to `LATESTVERSION` (inclusive). For
example, `.1.11.1.12.2.` means this JAR file supports 1.11, 1.12.2, and all
other versions between them.
- `MODVERSION` indicates this mod's version. Two JAR files with the same mod
version number means they have the same or similar features but are tailored
for different Minecraft client versions.

## Obtaining Source Code of This Mod
You can download source code of this mod as how you would when you download
another repository's code on GitHub, but chances are you are interested in
source code of a particular version, but the branch holding that version's
source code has been deleted.  
In accordance with terms of GNU General Public License, we are pleased to
provide you source code of every version of this mod. Since GitHub can only
automatically add source code archive of one branch to a release, we provide
Zip archives of source code of other branches with every release.  
On the [Releases](https://github.com/Leo3418/HBWHelper/releases) page, you
will find two asset entries named `Source code (zip)` and
`Source code (tar.gz)` for every release. Those allow you to download source
code of this mod for the **latest** Minecraft client version(s). There will
also be other Zip files whose name begin with `src`: these store source code of
this mod for **older** Minecraft client versions.  
**For contributors**: the best way for you to download a copy of this mod's
source code and work on it is to fork this repository and clone your fork to
your computer, as described in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
