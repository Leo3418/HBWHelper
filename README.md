## Planned Features

- [ ] Display graphical icons alongside those elements displayed

## Installation
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Leo3418/HBWHelper/releases) page, 
download a JAR file for the Minecraft version you are using, and copy it into 
the `mods` folder under your Minecraft game directory.

### Deciphering Version Number
HBW Helper's version number tries to stick with
[Minecraft Forge's suggested versioning
scheme](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).
The version number's format is `MCVERSION-MODVERSION`.
- `MCVERSION` indicates the Minecraft client version(s) that this JAR file
supports.  
Sometimes, one JAR file supports multiple Minecraft client versions. In this
case, this field's format will be `[OLDESTVERSION, LATESTVERSION]`. The client
versions supported are from `OLDESTVERSION` to `LATESTVERSION` (inclusive). For
example, `[1.11, 1.12.2]` means this JAR file supports 1.11, 1.12.2, and all
other versions between them.
- `MODVERSION` indicates this mod's version. Two JAR files with the same mod
version number means they have the same or similar features but are tailored
for different Minecraft client versions.

## Obtaining Source Code of This Mod
You can download source code of this mod as how you would when you download 
another repository's code on GitHub, but chances are you are interested in 
source code of a particular version, but the branch holding that version's 
source code has been deleted.  
In accordance with GNU GPLv3, we are pleased to provide you source code of 
every version of this mod. However, GitHub can only automatically add source 
code archive of one branch to a release. Therefore, we provide Zip archives 
of source code of other branches with every release.  
On the [Releases](https://github.com/Leo3418/HBWHelper/releases) page, you
will find two asset entries named `Source code (zip)` and 
`Source code (tar.gz)` for every release. Those allow you to download source
code of this mod for the **latest** Minecraft client version(s). There will 
also be other Zip files whose name begin with `src`: these store source code of
this mod for **older** Minecraft client versions.  
**For contributors**: the best way for you to download a copy of this mod's 
source code and work on it is to fork this repository and clone your fork to 
your computer, as described in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
