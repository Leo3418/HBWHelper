## Installation
Download a JAR file for the Minecraft version you are using from the
[Releases](https://github.com/Leo3418/HBWHelper/releases) page, and copy it
into the `mods` folder under your Minecraft game directory.

### Deciphering Version Number
HBW Helper's version number tries to stick with
[Minecraft Forge's suggested versioning
scheme](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).
The version number's format is `MCVERSION-MODVERSION`.
- `MCVERSION` indicates the Minecraft client version(s) that this JAR file
supports.  
Sometimes, one JAR file supports multiple Minecraft client versions. In this
case, this field's format will be `[OLDESTVERSION, LATESTVERSION]`. The client
versions supported are from `OLDESTVERSION` to `LATESTVERSION` (inclusive). For
example, `[1.11, 1.12.2]` means this JAR file supports 1.11, 1.12.2, and all
other versions between them.
- `MODVERSION` indicates this mod's version. Two JAR files with the same mod
version number means they have the same or similar features but are tailored
for different Minecraft client versions.
