HBW HELPER MC EXCEPTION

This HBW Helper MC Exception ("Exception") is an additional permission under
section 7 of GNU General Public License version 3 ("GPLv3").  It applies to
this entire Program.

As a Minecraft mod, some parts of HBW Helper have to be linked with Minecraft
itself directly, rather than Minecraft Forge.  Minecraft is a
GPLv3-incompatible proprietary program.  Linking this mod with it will produce
a covered work with non-free components from Minecraft, and conveying the
resulting work may cause legal issues surrounding GPLv3.  The purpose of this
Exception is to allow conveying of such resulting work.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, GPLv3 grants you the right to remove
this Exception.  To promote subsequent contributions and enhancements to the
covered work, you are encouraged to preserve this Exception in the conveying so
others can keep improving the work and distributing any work based on it,
though you are not obligated to do so.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or combining it
with Minecraft (or a modified version of that library), containing parts
covered by the terms of Minecraft End User License Agreement, the licensors of
this Program grant you additional permission to convey the resulting work.
