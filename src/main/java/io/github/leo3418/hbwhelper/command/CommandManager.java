/**
 * The command manager of this mod, for processing this mod's commands.
 * <p>
 * With Minecraft 1.13, Mojang introduced
 * <a href="https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier">Brigadier</a>, a new command
 * library for the game. Minecraft Forge provides ways to register commands with
 * this library on the server side; however, the commands of this mod are
 * intended to be registered on the client side. Neither Minecraft nor Forge
 * offers any utility for client-side command registration.
 * <p>
 * This class enables registration and processing of this mod's client-side
 * commands.
 * <p>
 * This is a Singleton class. Only one instance of this class may be created
 * per runtime.
